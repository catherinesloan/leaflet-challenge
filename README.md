The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
URL of the JSON representation of the data for 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days': https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson 

A useful link I use to inspect the JSON https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

LEVEL 1: Basic Visualization

Importing & visualising the data.

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A legend that provides context for my map data.
